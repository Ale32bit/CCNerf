# CCNerf

This NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 nerfs the Ender (Advanced) Wireless Modem by removing their ability to send messages across dimensions and by limiting their range to what would be for the normal wireless modem, but unaffected by the weather.

Meaningful code is located in `src/java/me/alexdevs/dsmp/ccnerf/mixin`.

This mod was made for the Devs.SMP server.

# CCNerf

This NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 nerfs the Ender (Advanced) Wireless Modem by removing their ability to send messages across dimensions and by limiting their range to 2x of what would be the normal wireless modem range.

Meaningful code is located in `src/java/me/alexdevs/dsmp/ccnerf/mixin`.

This mod was made for the Devs.SMP server.

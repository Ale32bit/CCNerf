# CCNerf

This NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 nerfs the Ender (Advanced) Wireless Modem by:
* Limiting the range to what would be for the normal wireless modems, but doubled and unaffected by the weather.
* Limiting interdimensionality by only allowing Ender Wireless Modems to transmit to other modems in the same position but different dimension.

Meaningful code is located in `src/java/me/alexdevs/dsmp/ccnerf/mixin`.

This mod was made for the Devs.SMP server.
